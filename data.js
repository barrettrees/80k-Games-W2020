Gameplay is random, and much of it's out of your control: it changes depending on the guards' racism, the border's security level, your anxiety, your ethnicity, your appearance, and so forth. You have a variety of possible responses, based on constitutional rights, your self-respect, your personal background, and more. All of these responses may or may not help you cross. As you talk to immigration authorities, check your privilege: it will open and close certain doors.</p>"
